       Few encyclopaedias have a “nature” article. The one written by Diderot and d’Alembert,
       in 1751, was already wary of “this rather vague term, often used, but seldom defined, which 
       philosophers tend to use too much”, and Buffon, who was in charge of writing it, quickly abandoned
       the project. He was urgently replaced by d’Alembert and de Jaucourt, who only provided a timid catalogue 
       of “its various meanings [which] are so numerous that one author can count as many as 14 or 15″ , an article 
       consisting essentially of cross-references to terms deemed more satisfactory, albeit heterogeneous, such as 
       “System of the world”, “Cause”, “Essence”, “Providence” and even “God”.
